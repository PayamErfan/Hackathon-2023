Another diet -- DASH-Sodium -- calls for cutting back sodium to 1,500 milligrams a day (about 2/3 teaspoon). Studies of people on the DASH-Sodium plan lowered their blood pressure as well. The DASH dietcalls for a certain number of servings daily from various food groups. The number of servings you require may vary, depending on how many calories you need per day. You can make gradual changes. For instance, start by limiting yourself to 2,400 milligrams of sodium per day (about 1 teaspoon).

These amounts include all sodium eaten, including sodium in food products as well as in what you cook with or add at the table.
