High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, likeThe Atkins Diet, have been widely promoted as effectiveweight loss plans. These programs generally recommend that dieters get 30% to 50% of their total calories from protein. By comparison, the AmericanHeartAssociation, the National Cholesterol Education Program, and the AmericanCancerSociety all recommend a diet in which a smaller percentage of calories come from protein. The American Heart Association recommends getting 10% - 35% of your daily calories from protein. This is about 46 grams of protein for adult women and 56 grams for adult men. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body. Without enough carbs for energy, the body breaks down fat into ketones. The ketones then become the primary source of fuel for the body. When ketones become the primary source of fuel, this puts your body in a state calledketosis. When your fat stores become a primary energy source, you may lose weight. Some experts have raised concern about high-protein, low-carb diets. If you're considering a high-protein diet, check with your doctor or a nutritionist to see if it's OK for you. They can help you come up with a plan that will make sure you're getting enoughfruits and vegetables, and that you're getting lean protein foods. Remember, weight loss that lasts is usually based on changes you can live with for a long time, not a temporary diet. American Heart Association: "Protein and Heart Health."
