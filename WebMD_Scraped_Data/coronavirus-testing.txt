If youdon't feel well, you may wonder if you have COVID-19. Tests can tell whether you have it now. Antibody testing can show if you had it already. The CDC has offered the following recommendations for who should consider being tested: If you know or suspect you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, you should get tested. The CDC recommends a COVID-19 test called a nasopharyngeal swab for coronavirus. A special 6-inch cotton swab is inserted up each of your nostrils and moved around for about 15 seconds. It won’t hurt, but it might be uncomfortable. The material from inside your nose will show whether you are negative or positive. Home self-testing is available and you can get your results in 15 minutes or less. Depending on the reason behind your testing, you may need official lab results which are done by a medical professional. The results are analyzed by a laboratory. COVID-19 tests include swabs of: If you have a cough with mucus, called a “wet” or “productive” cough, your doctor might want to test some of what you can cough up. Testing can take place in medical clinics, hospitals, or private laboratories. Each state has several public health labs that do testing. For information about testing in your state, onlineat the CDC. “Serology” tests look for antibodies. Your body makes them when you've had an infection. These COVID-19 tests spot two types of antibodies: A swab or spit test can tell only if you have the virus in your body at that moment. But a blood test shows whether you've ever been infected with the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in researchers' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. Drive-through coronavirus testing Some hospitals and agencies continue to have centers where you can get a COVID-19 test without getting out of your car. You may need to register online or by phone, or you might need a doctor's order first. Be sure to check before you go. The FDA has approved several at-home tests. They include rapid tests where you get your results at home within minutes as well as home collection kits which are then sent to a lab for analysis. You'll collect your own sample through an at-home nasal swab. Then, you'll send the sample to Labcorp, where they'll do tests. Your results will be available through an online portal. A health care provider will also reach out if you have a positive or invalid test. You can buy the at-home test online or in stores with no prescription. The collection process is slightly different based on your age: The FDA has approved several other at-home tests. They include home collection kits which are then sent to a lab for analysis, as well as rapid tests where you get your results at home within minutes. If you have a health care plan, you can get an at-home FDA-authorized COVID-19 test from some pharmacies or stores for free. If your pharmacy or store isn't set up for the free tests, you may have to pay upfront. Make sure you keep your receipt. Your insurance will reimburse you up to $12 per test. If you don't have insurance, you can still get a free test. The government has set up a website to send tests if you request them. You can use this website whether or not you have insurance. You can also get free at-home tests from some community health centers or health clinics. Check theCDC's website. Some of the available rapid tests include: At-home saliva tests are available where you spit into a vial and mail it to a lab. Free, in-person COVID-19 testing is available in most communities. Some locations require an appointment while others are drive-up. Antibody testing usually requires an appointment. Most locations are listed online, but you can also call your doctor, your local hospital, the health department, or an urgent care center about testing locations near you. If you think it's an emergency, call 911. Whoever you call, you'll need to tell them about your symptoms over the phone or during an online visit. They may ask you some of these questions: In April 2022, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a new type of COVID-19 test called the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer. It looks for signs of the virus in breath samples. A trained expert can give you this test in less than 3 minutes. The test uses something called “gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). With this, it can find chemical mixtures and identify compounds that are related to the virus that causes COVID-19. In studies, experts found that the breathalyzer for COVID-19 accurately found 91.2 percent of all positive cases and correctly picked up on 99.3 percent on all negative cases. You can't get a COVID-19 breath test at home. They're only available in doctor's offices, hospitals, and mobile testing sites. Rapid test results take about 15 minutes. It may take a lab about 24 hours to run your test. But you might not get your results for several days based on possible backlogs in the lab. Future tests might be faster. A positive COVID-19 test means you currently have or recently had the virus. Monitor your symptoms and get medical help right away if you have trouble breathing, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Take steps to avoid spreading the virus: If your test is positive and you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should isolate yourself until you meet all these criteria: If you tested positive but didn't have symptoms, isolate yourself for 5 days. If you still have no symptoms, you can leave your house, but keep wearing your mask around others for 5 more days. There usually is no need to be retested if you have been in isolation for 10 to 14 days if your symptoms were mild. If you had a moderate or severe case of COVID-19, you'll need to isolate for longer. If your COVID-19 test is negative, you probably didn't have the virus at the time of the test. But you can still get sick later. Follow distancing guidelines, and wash your hands often. There's a very small chance that your COVID-19 test results could be wrong. This is called a false positive or false negative. Your doctor or health care professional will help you decide what to do based on your symptoms and health history. If you can't get tested, you may still need medical help. Call your doctor if you don't feel well or have a high fever or a cough.
