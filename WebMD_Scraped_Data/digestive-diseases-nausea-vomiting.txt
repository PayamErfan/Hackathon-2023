For children, it is common for vomiting to occur from aviral infection,food poisoning,milk allergy, motion sickness, overeating or feeding,coughing, or blockedintestinesand illnesses in which the child has ahigh fever. The timing of the nausea or vomiting can indicate the cause. When appearing shortly after a meal, nausea or vomiting may be caused by food poisoning,gastritis(inflammation of the stomach lining), anulcer, orbulimia. Nausea or vomiting one to eight hours after a meal may also indicatefood poisoning. However, certain food- borne bacteria, such as salmonella, can take longer to produce symptoms.

Another concern isdehydration. Adults have a lower risk of becoming dehydrated, because they can usually detect the symptoms ofdehydration(such as increased thirst and dry lips or mouth). But young children have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated, especially if they also havediarrhea, because they often are unable to communicate symptoms of dehydration. Adults caring for sick children need to be aware of these visiblesigns of dehydration: dry lips and mouth, sunkeneyes, and rapid breathing or pulse. In infants, also watch for decreased urination and a sunken fontanelle (soft spot on top of the baby's head). Recurrent vomiting in pregnancy can lead to a serious condition calledhyperemesis gravidarumin which the mother may develop fluid and mineral imbalances that can endanger their life or that of their unborn child.
