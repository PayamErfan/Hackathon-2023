They could be found in the environment by using advanced detection devices, found after specific testing, or found by a doctor reporting a medical diagnosis of an illness caused by an agent.

If enough warning is received, these measures should be started as soon as a biological agent is suspected. SOURCES: eMedicineHealth: "How Biological Agents Are Delivered and Detected."
