Many newborn babies developjaundice, a condition in which theskinand whites of theeyesare yellowish in color, within a few days after birth. In fact, about half of all newborns develop mild jaundice in the first few days. In premature babies, jaundice may start early and last longer than in full-term babies. If bilirubin levels become extremely high, complications such asbrain damage(kernicterus),cerebral palsy, anddeafnesscan occur. Jaundice typically occurs because newborns normally produce increased levels of bilirubin which is referred to as "physiologic jaundice." Bilirubin, which is yellowish in color, is produced when redblood cellsare broken down. Bilirubin is removed from the bloodstream by theliver. In newborns, the body may produce more bilirubin than thelivercan process. Physiologic jaundice usually appears within a few days after birth and resolves within two weeks. Other types ofnewbornjaundice can be due to prematurity, problems related tobreastfeeding, infection,bloodtype mismatch between mom and baby as well as other blood or liver problems. Since many mothers and babies leave the hospital soon after delivery, jaundice may not appear until babies are at home. Anewborncheck is typically scheduled with your pediatrician to check for jaundice within the first few days of going home from the hospital. It is important to contact your doctor if you notice signs of jaundice in your baby. If you suspect jaundice you will likely need to see your doctor that same day. While jaundice is usually very treatable, in the most extreme cases it can causebrain damage. SOURCES: Hoekelman, R.
