Gynecomastia is a condition that makes breast tissue swell in boys and men. It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called "pseudogynecomastia." Althoughbreastsdon't develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue. Boys' bodies mostly make a hormone calledtestosterone, which guides their sexual growth duringpuberty. But males also make someestrogen-- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls. When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man's body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes. Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree. Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore. This might make you worry that you havebreast cancer, which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign ofcancer, but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out. Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness. See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts. A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known. In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are: Someinfantboys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies.

When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as anendocrinologist, who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body. How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs. If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.
