Some people withrheumatoid arthritis(RA) get a rare disorder known as Felty's Syndrome (FS). It causes anenlarged spleenand a very low whitebloodcount. It can be painful and lead to serious infections in some cases. Less than 3% of people with RA develop FS, but those in their 50s, 60s, and 70s who've had RA for 10 years or longer are more likely to have it. It's also three times more common in women than men. Children rarely get FS. Doctors aren't sure what causes FS. Your whiteblood cellsmay have stopped fighting infections like they should. Or your bone marrow could be making abnormal white blood cells. Another theory is that your immune system attacks your white blood cells by mistake. FS doesn't always run in families, but some genes that raise your chances of getting it could be passed down to you. Signs of FS are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis. They also overlap otherautoimmune diseases-- a disease in which your immune system attacks your own healthy cells -- likelupus. Because of that, FS can be hard to diagnose. You may have: You also will have a swollen spleen -- a fist-sized organ behind your left ribs. It controls the amount of white blood cells in your body and plays a key part in yourimmune system. If yourspleenis bigger than normal, you may feel pain behind your left rib cage. You also may feel full soon after you eat because it's pressing against yourstomach. Other times, an enlarged spleen doesn't cause any symptoms. If your doctor thinks you might have FS, they'll feel around yourstomachto see if your spleen is enlarged. An imaging test may be needed to confirm it: Your doctor will also have you take a blood test. People with FS have very low levels of special white blood cells called neutrophils. These are important for fighting offbacterial infections. If your RA is under control, you may not need treatment for FS. If you do need help with your symptoms, there are ways to manage them: SOURCES: Almoalim, H.The Journal of Rheumatology,January 2005.
