Toothdecay is the destruction oftoothstructure and can affect both the enamel (the outer coating of thetooth) and the dentin layer of the tooth.  Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as breads, cereals, milk, soda, fruits, cakes, or candy are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in themouthdigest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, andsalivacombine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities.  To prevent tooth decay:   Researchers are developing new means to prevent tooth decay. One study found that a chewing gum that contains the sweetener xylitol temporarily retarded the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, several materials that slowly release fluoride over time, which will help prevent further decay, are being explored. These materials would be placed between teeth or in pits and fissures of teeth.Toothpastesandmouthrinses that can reverse and "heal" early cavities are also being studied.
