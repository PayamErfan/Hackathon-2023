  Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber Syndrome. This is a rare condition that is present at birth that affects the development of blood vessels, soft tissues, bones and sometimes the lymphatic system. This image shows an adult in which the vascular malformations have begun to spread in a condition called angiomatous process. Sometimes a combination of port-wine stain and vascular malformations at birth may be the first indication of Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber Syndrome. Vascular malformations, varicosities, and phlebectasia develop as the child ages and usually cover an entire limb or other body area. Skeletal abnormalities are also possible leading to asymmetric limb enlargement or even webbed fingers or toes.
