Do you have a child who was born with a birth defect, such ascleft lipor palate? Are you a woman who has undergone amastectomy? Or, perhaps you've experienced a traumatic injury or disease that has permanently affected some part of your body that you want fixed. Reconstructive surgery can help repair the part of your body that is affected from any of these issues. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 6.8 million reconstructive surgery procedures were performed in 2020 (the latest year for which statistics are available). If you can imagine how many injuries, birth defects, or disfigurement issues arise in our imperfect lives, there is a procedure that can help improve the problem, whatever it may be. These include: Like your issue that you want corrected, your procedure will be very individual. Your surgeon will take a detailed medical history and evaluate your case based on your desired results and medical necessity. For example, do you have a traumatic burn that affects underlying muscles and impacts your mobility? Have you hadcancerand require surgery on multiple body parts? Your surgeon will help you weigh all the options and the two of you can decide together which one best suits you. Unlike elective cosmetic procedures, most insurance carriers cover the costs of reconstructive surgery, especially if you are experiencing a functional problem. To be safe, be sure to have your surgeon write a letter and take photos detailing your case.   SOURCES: American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. American Cancer Society.
