  Also known as hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia, nail-patella syndrome is a genetic disease that largely affects the development of your finger and toenails but can cause changes in the development of knees, elbows and the pelvis. Nails may be absent or underdeveloped and discolored, split, ridged, or pitted. It is caused by the LMX1B gene. Those with Nail-patella syndrome are also at risk for kidney disease and glaucoma.
