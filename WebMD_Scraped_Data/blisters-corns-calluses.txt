Three of the more commonskinconditions that people experience areblisters, corns, andcalluses. Blisters The skin covering the blister helps protect it from infection. Draining a blister is not recommended because of the risk of infection, but under certain conditions, your doctor may recommend you "pop" the blister with a sterile needle to allow the skin to re-attach. However, don't cut the skin away unless it is already torn and drying out. Keep the blister clean. Gently wash the area with mild soap and water or a cleansing towel and then apply antibacterial cream to the blister. Cover it with gauze and secure it with hypoallergenic tape to help protect the skin and prevent infection. Change the dressing at least once a day and wear different shoes until the blister heals. Keep the wound covered with antibacterial ointment and a bandage until it is healed. Corns Don't try to cut the corn or remove it with a sharp object. After you take a bath or shower, while your skin is still soft, use a pumice stone or an emery board to smooth and gently remove the build-up of tissue. Move the emery board or pumice stone in one direction only. You can also use cushioned or medicated pads. Calluses Don't try to cut the callus or remove it with a sharp object. After your bath or shower, use a pumice stone to gently remove the build-up of tissue. You can use cushioned pads, donut pads, and insoles to keep the pressure off the callus area.
